# Spring buzzziness & another great experience working with volunteers.

![](/uploads/2016/04/13412897\_1104302182944307\_616998185550074119\_n.jpg)This year is something else! Last year it was just warm and dry between February and October. Now we are getting it all: sun, rain, wind, warm, cold. Really starting to sound like a 'farmer' talking about the weather all the time. That's just what happens when living so integrated with nature. We are surely feeling the spring energy ramping up and we are trying to keep up with all the seasonal changes going on. Today \(April 12th\) we are bracing for a storm that's on the way and might dump 6 cm of rain in 4 days....... fingers crossed!

In the last three weeks we unexpectedly had some great help from two volunteers Aline and Duarte who contacted us through HelpX. The collaboration with them was really fluid and fun and together we got so many things done it felt like they were here for much longer than 3 weeks!

Just to enjoy and remember all the work that was done:
- Woodchipping a LARGE quantity of piles of sticks we had been saving up.
- Garden path and bed building.
- Wood management.
- Clearing out basements.
- Dogbed sowing.
- Old apple crate cleaning and sanding.
- Seeding and planting.
- Clearing pieces of our new terrain on the other side of the Dão.
- Plastics and trash removal from 'The Island', left by the high river of early January.
- Mimosa removal.

WOW!!!!! Thanks Aline and Duarte!
