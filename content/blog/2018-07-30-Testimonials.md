We had such a wonderful time at the Moinhos this summer! It's a small little paradise and it was a perfect place for our summer break. Our daughter \(2 years\) had so much fun playing and swimming in the river, chasing the animals and lying in the hammock \(and we did too ;-\) \). Thanks Steven, Freya and Marcel for welcoming us at your place! Definitely highly recommendable!

 A heavenly place run by special people who know what hospitality means! What a special place, a nice atmosphere, enjoying good dinners together, heartwarming, pure and green! Next time I come to Portugal this quinta is on the top of my list of places to visit again. Thank you very much!

 Well, paradise exists! What a beautiful spot!
With thanks to Steven and Freya who put their heart and soul into making everyone feel good and have attention for it all: people and nature!

 A wonderful place to slow down and let go. The hosts are hospitable and social people, nice to be in touch with. The meals are original and delicious!

Me and my kids have already been to the Moinhos twice. The apartments are spacious, clean, nicely designed and affordable. It is such a nice place for the kids to explore, play in the water and build huts on the island. Freya and Steven create an open atmosphere that makes people feel at ease. The evening dinners under the fig were very special for us and will stay in our memories. I’d recommend to anyone that enjoys nature and peace to spend their vacation time at Moinhos do Dão.
