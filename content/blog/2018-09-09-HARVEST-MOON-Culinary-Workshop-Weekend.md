# HARVEST MOON - Culinary Workshop Weekend

Date: 2018-09-09 11:54:41


Peppers, tomatoes and zucchinis in many different shapes and colors have absorbed the summer sun and are sweet and ripe, ready to be consumed or preserved. This weekend is dedicated to the abundance of the Mediterranean September harvest.

Spend your weekend cooking vegetarian dishes and learning preservation techniques to bring the goodness of the summer sun into the colder months of the year. The workshop ingredients are picked in the garden of Moinhos do Dão or bought on the local markets and are the basis and inspiration for the menu. Moinhos do Dão provides a comfortable setting for an inspiring and relaxing weekend. Participants are free to spend time at the quinta before and after the workshops and can book extra nights.

Workshop teacher Rosario Pinheiro - Designer, Illustrator and Chef.

Rosário learned how to make soup at age 4, in the stone-floored kitchen of her grandmother and grew up with traditional Portuguese cooking: pure and simple. In recent years she turned her passion for cooking into a profession and took a cooking course at the School of Hospitality and Tourism of Oporto. Rosario has been sharing her cooking skills and personal tastes through her ‘healthy kitchen project’ Grão a Grão, in workshops, professional training and dinners to order. She worked in several kitchens such as Kontrast in Oslo \(Michelin Guide\), Nomiya Sushi Bar, and daTerra Vegetarian Restaurant, and is still hungry to learn and share this great love that is cooking.
