# Experience the quinta

Date: 2019-03-06 17:36:56

At Moinhos do Dão we run a small eco-tourism business with accommodations for rent and shaded places for camping. The Beira Alta region of Portugal and our location on the banks of the river Dão is ideal for people who want to be surrounded by nature and experience what it is like to live on an eco home stead. Spending time at Moinhos do Dão offers a true ‘back to nature’ experience. You will find a wide variety of flora and fauna here like many different types of ferns, wild lavender and animals such as the metallic-blue King Fisher bird and river otters. The focus on living in harmony with nature plays a key role in the way life is lived at MdD and we want to make that experience tangible for people that stay with us.


**Facilities:**

On the quinta the old Miller’s house, the mills and barns have been restored and now house several rustic guest quarters and the terraced terrain provides space for camping. Our river beach and various areas on and around the quinta provide an ideal natural space for relaxing and for exploring. Three nights a week our restaurant serves meals inspired by a ‘Portuguese & World Menu’ for which we use produce from our garden and regional, and seasonal products. Our quinta is 'off-grid' and electricity is generated with water and solar power and water comes from our own well. We offer guests services such as: a self-guided hikes, vegetables and herbs from our biological garden, in depth information about cultural trips, and information about wine tasting, to name a few.

Surroundings and activities:

The Beira Alta region, is still defined by rural Portuguese life as it has been for ages and MdD is an ideal holiday spot if you want to explore this ‘old Portugal’ and visit historic villages, cities, markets and wineries. Daytrips can be made to for instance the Serra da Estrela \(highest mountains of Portugal\), the Atlantic Ocean, Coimbra or Porto which are all within a 1 – 1.5 hours drive distance.
