# Joshua Glass artist in residence September 2021

Date: 2021-09-15 20:18:11

Moinhos do Dão is excited to host Joshua in the artist in residence program. In his work the domains of art, social dynamics and nature intersect and this touches on many aspects of life here at the quinta. It seems therefore very fitting to host Joshua after a quiet period in the residency program.

**Join us & participate!**

On Saturday, 25 Sept., in collaboration with the people and land of  Moinhos do Dão \~ Eco Quinta, Joshua will co-host a participatory moment to present his work.

**To sign up and**** receive participation details ****email: info@moinhosdodao.org**


The work of Joshua Glass elaborates on the intersection of *performance art* + *social experimentation* + *nature connection*. He designs his offerings to be embodied so we can practice:

exchanging with non-humans
reviewing the boundaries of self and other
coexisting in community

Recently, Joshua has produced participatory performances, community-building events, artistic installations, workshops, and a non-profit organization called [The Treehouse Maastricht](http://fb.com/thetreehousemaastricht).The Treehouse was co-founded in 2018 in the Netherlands as a public coffeehouse for developing emotional integrity and silliness in the context of deep community. With The Treehouse, Joshua researched and implemented dynamic governance, [microsolidarity](https://microsolidarity.cc/) \(mutual-aid\), and socially experimental dinners.In 2020, Joshua graduated from the Interdisciplinary Arts program at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Currently, he's loosely based in Amsterdam.**While in residence at Moinhos do Dão,** Joshua will continue his research within themes of regenerative culture, nature connection, and social design. He'll explore questions including:

Which nature-based practices strengthen a palpable, personal relationship with non-human beings?
Why are humans blamed for destroying planet earth?
What's a regenerative lifestyle, why's it important, and how can I live one?
How can I access and trust animate intelligence \(i.e. non-rational\) and foster an integrated intelligence to guide my actions?
How can principles of nature and permaculture nurture a win-win relationship between human and non-human beings?
