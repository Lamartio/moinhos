TRAVELING TO MOINHOS DO DAO BY CAR. 

NOTE: 
***We strongly advise you to use the directions **below and not to trust your GPS!***
** Also, ****the last 2 km. of the road leading to our quinta is not suitable for cars with large caravans or motorhomes!**

**Directions: **
On the N25/IP5 between Mangualde and Viseu take the exit 21/N16 \(= Fagilde\). Drive through the first roundabout into Fagilde, continuing up and through the village until reaching the second roundabout.  Take the first right off the roundabout in the direction of Vila Garcia. Follow this road \(R.Principal\) make a right into the one-lane Rua Escola \(second right\), then make a left at the end of this short road, onto R.Nova. Follow R. Nova which drops down into the village. Keep following this asphalt road between yellow houses, right down through the pine forest. At the end of the paved road, take the hairpin turn left and follow the dirt road \(from here it is another 2 km. with some narrow and winding parts: drive carefully\). Along this route to the Moinhos do Dao you'll find several light blue marks.
 Turn right before the wall at the "Convento", and drive over the bridge over a creek. On this road always keep right. After about 1 km. the trail goes down sharply. You will pass our neighbors \(a white, restored house and a farm\). Here, in front of their house, make a left turn and follow the path \(through the grape fields\) to the river below all the way up to the split of the road and our welcome and parking sign. Park your car and walk towards the buildings where you will find us.

Below are two maps. The first map is the **CORRECT MAP** to reach the Moinhos do Dão from Viseu, the largest nearby town:

The second map, below, is an **INCORRECT MAP** that will often be given from Google Maps or other GPS services \(we are trying to correct this\).  This map will attempt to lead you to the other side of the Dão river, from us, and you will be stuck there, unable to reach us from that side.  **AVOID TAKING THIS ROUTE!!!**
