**Directions to Moinhos do Dão from A25 & N16 \(Fagilde\)**

Along this route to the Moinhos do Dao you'll find several light blue marks and signs.

**Option 1:** From the A25 between Mangualde and Viseu take the exit 21/N16 \(= Fagilde\).

Drive through Fagilde \(on the N16\) and go right at the roundabout in the direction of Vila Garcia.

**Option 2:** From the N16 between Mangualde and Viseu you drive to Fagilde and the roundabout at these coordinates: 40.622375, -7.802266. Here you drive in the direction of Vila Garcia on the R. Principal.

**From the roundabout the directions are the same:**

Follow this road \(R. da Escola\) make a right into the small Rua do Rosmaninhal \(second right with MdD sign\), make a left at the end of this short road, onto R. da Cruz. Follow R. Nova which drops down into the village. Keep following this asphalt road between yellow houses \(MdD sign\), onto the Rua Q. ta Convento right down through the pine forest. At the end of the paved road, take the hairpin turn \(MdD sign\) left and follow the dirt road which is abut 1.5 km with some bumpy parts: drive carefully.

Turn right before the wall at the "Mosteiro", \(MdD sign\) and drive over the bridge over a creek. On this road always keep right. After about 1 km. the trail goes down sharply. You will pass our neighbors \(a white, restored house and an abandoned farm\). Here, in front of the abandoned house, make a left turn and follow the path to the river below all the way up to the split of the road and our welcome and parking sign.

Park your car and walk towards the buildings where you will find us.
