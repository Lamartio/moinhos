# Hosting Events and Activities

Date: 2024-03-06 12:52:27


Moinhos do Dão is a beautifully situated quinta that can be used for group events and activities. We have hosted events such as weddings, outdoor yoga workshops, writing workshop weeks, group hiking holidays and woman retreats. Activities we mainly host are in the areas of arts & crafts, sustainable living practices, wellness, environmental education and outdoor activities.

We welcome workshop facilitators and event organizers to contact us if you are interested in using Moinhos do Dão for your activities. We are available for co-creation of activities and collaborate on program development, marketing and adjusting facilities for the event. If the activity you want to organize suits the quinta in terms of our facilities, we can offer a free weekend stay in order get to know the place and us with the goal of creating a good experience.

**Practical Information for Event Hosting:**

We host events in the period between mid-April until the end of October.
